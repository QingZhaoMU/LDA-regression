# LDA-with-auxiliary-information
This branch contains codes of simulation studies that aim to evaluate the performance of several approaches to incorporate auxiliary information (e.g. covariates, remote sensing data) into Latent Dirichlet Allocation models.
So far three approaches are considered. 1. Jointly model species data and remote sensing data, both of which share the same theta; 2. Link theta with covariates using a beta regression; 3. Link theta with covariates using a logistic regression. 

9/18/2017. I just uploaded several files for the latest code of logistic regression applied in LDA models. These code should be good. Customized functions and data simulation are in separate files to make the code shorter and more readable.
