# LDA-with-auxiliary-information
This branch contains codes of simulation studies that aim to evaluate the performance of several approaches to incorporate auxiliary information (e.g. covariates, remote sensing data) into Latent Dirichlet Allocation models.
So far three approaches are considered. 1. Link theta with covariates using a beta regression; 2. Link theta with covariates using a logistic regression. 3. Jointly model species data and remote sensing data, both of which share the same theta.
